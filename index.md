## 🏆 Graduation Project
**Static Timing Analysis EDA Tool**  
Supervised by Mabrains

- Developed an open-source Static Timing Analysis (STA) tool for integration with OpenLane digital ASIC design flow.
- Programmed the tool using Python for efficient file manipulation and utilized Linux scripting for file handling.
- The tool processes Verilog netlists post-Synthesis, converting them into a graph using NetworkX.
- Integrated timing details from Liberty `.lib` files and constraints from JSON configurations into the graph structure.
- Utilized a Breadth-First-Search (BFS) algorithm for delay calculation, ensuring accurate timing analysis and generating detailed timing condition reports.
